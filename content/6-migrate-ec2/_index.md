#### Export to EC2

As your application scale and management requirements grow, we move Lightsail instances to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
We will create a Lightsail snapshot then export to the EC2 service. Next we will create an EC2 Instance (a virtual machine similar to a Lightsail instance).
