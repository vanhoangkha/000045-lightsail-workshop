To clean up this lab, please follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Instances" tab. For each of the 3 virtual machines, click the three dots button, then click "Delete," and confirm the deletion by clicking "Yes." Do this for all virtual machines created for this lab.

2. Click on the "Databases" tab. Click the three dots next to "Workshop-DB-Instance," then click "Delete," and confirm the deletion by clicking "Yes."

3. Click on the "Networking" tab. For each static IP address you created in this lab, click the three dots button, then click "Delete," and confirm the deletion by clicking "Yes."

4. Click on the "Snapshots" tab. For each snapshot you created in this lab, open the "Instance snapshot" dropdown, click the three dots button, then click "Delete snapshot." Then, click "Yes" to confirm the deletion.

At this point, your Lightsail dashboard should be empty of resources. If you still have resources running in the dashboard, ensure they were deployed in this lab, then follow the steps above to delete them.
