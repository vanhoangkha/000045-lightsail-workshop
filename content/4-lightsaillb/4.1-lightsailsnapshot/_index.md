#### Create Lightsail snapshot

Lightsail makes it super simple to create your snapshot instances with just one click. These snapshots can be used to backup and restore instances, increase or decrease instance size, or create new instances.


1. Return to the [Lightsail console] interface (https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/webapp/home/). Click on the name of our Lightsail instance.

{{%notice tip%}}
The status will change to snapshotting, the snapshot creation time is more than 5 minutes, and you need to wait for the snapshot to complete before proceeding to the next step.
