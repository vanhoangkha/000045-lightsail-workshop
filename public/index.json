In this section, we will deploy a highly available database, meaning there is an active database and a passive database deployed. Both receive all writes/edits. If the active database encounters any issues, the passive database will automatically be upgraded to the \u0026lsquo;Active\u0026rsquo; state, ensuring continuity and availability. We will deploy the database first because this deployment takes 10-15 minutes, and you can proceed with other steps rather than waiting for it to be ready.\nTake some time to get familiar with the Lightsail control panel. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready, click on the Databases tab, and then click on Create database. We will use the default MySQL version. Scroll down and click on Specify login credentials.\nFor the User name field, type \u0026lsquo;LightsailAdmin\u0026rsquo; (note the capitalization).\nUncheck the option Create a strong password for me and enter \u0026lsquo;Sunny2DAY!\u0026rsquo; as your new password.\nFor the \u0026ldquo;Master database name\u0026rdquo; field, type \u0026lsquo;WordPress\u0026rsquo; (again, pay attention to capitalization).\nChoose a database plan. We will select a STANDARD database plan to save time and money. If you want to use the \u0026lsquo;High-Availability\u0026rsquo; database, it will automatically switch in case of issues with the primary database.\nChoose the $15 database plan with 1GB of memory and 2 vCPUs. We need to give our database resource/object a specific name. In this case, this resource will run multiple databases, so we will also add identifying tags.\nName the database object \u0026lsquo;Workshop-DB-Instance\u0026rsquo;. Since we can\u0026rsquo;t see the name of the databases running inside the database instance without logging into that instance, we\u0026rsquo;ll add a tag with the database name. Although we typed \u0026lsquo;WordPress\u0026rsquo; for the database name, Lightsail adds a \u0026lsquo;db\u0026rsquo; prefix, so the database we\u0026rsquo;re creating is actually \u0026lsquo;dbWordPress\u0026rsquo;.\nUnder \u0026lsquo;Key-value tags,\u0026rsquo; click on Add key-value tag and add:\nKey = dbname\rValue = dbWordPress Select Create database. It will take about 15 minutes to create the database. While we wait for the database to initialize, we will proceed to the next step \u0026lsquo;Deploy a WordPress Instance.\u0026rsquo; Right-click on Instances and select \u0026lsquo;Open in a new tab\u0026rsquo; because we will need to come back to this page later to get the database instance Endpoint URL. We have completed the first step in creating a remote database so that all our applications can use it. If there is an issue with the primary database instance, there will be a second instance running (hidden from you) to take over if needed, ensuring higher availability for the database profile.\n"

To provide a comprehensive experience, WordPress and Akaunting will be deployed on Lightsail OS blueprints, while Prestashop will use the Application Blueprint.\nAfter each application is deployed, we will explore how to enhance application security, create backups, scale to larger virtual machines as your business grows, and set up alerts for proactive system monitoring.\nOverview In this hands-on exercise, we will deploy various open-source applications on Amazon Lightsail and configure Lightsail resources to help you scale your applications as your business expands while safeguarding applications from their default state. Each step will include several best practices to make you an Amazon Lightsail expert.\nApplications to be Deployed We will deploy WordPress as a blog/website, Prestashop as an e-commerce website, and Akaunting as a financial application. All three applications are open-source products that you can self-host. The lessons in this hands-on exercise also apply to all other applications you may deploy on Lightsail.\nCost of the Exercise and Cleanup This exercise is currently free if you haven\u0026rsquo;t exhausted your 720 hours of free Lightsail resources. If you\u0026rsquo;ve already used up your free Lightsail resources, this exercise, with a runtime of 2 hours, will cost approximately $0.085. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t complete the exercise, you should remove the resources you deploy to avoid incurring charges once the free resources are depleted.\n"

	"content": "Upgrading to a Larger Instance As your website or application attracts more users, the resources required to handle the increased traffic will continue to grow. Lightsail makes it easy to scale up your website or application with just a few simple clicks. In this section, we will enhance the resources for our WordPress website to handle more concurrent connections. To switch to a larger instance, we need to manually create a snapshot of the current instance (this should have been done in the previous section). If you\u0026rsquo;re not already in the snapshot page, navigate to \u0026lsquo;Home\u0026rsquo; \u0026gt; \u0026lsquo;Workshop-WordPress\u0026rsquo; \u0026gt; Snapshots.\nClick on the three dots on the right side of the snapshot row.\nChoose Create new instance. In this article, you will see the source snapshot and the location of the instance. We will keep all these settings as they are. We will enable the snapshot feature. Select the \u0026ldquo;Enabled Automatic Snapshots\u0026rdquo; checkbox. Under the \u0026lsquo;Choose a new instance plan\u0026rsquo; section, we will increase the virtual machine size from 1GB/1vCPU to 4GB/2vCPU at a cost of $20 USD. Click on $20 USD. In this case, to give a new name to our instance in the \u0026lsquo;Identify your instance\u0026rsquo; section, enter \u0026lsquo;Workshop-WordPress-Medium\u0026rsquo; to differentiate between the original size and the new size.\nSelect Create instance.\nA new virtual machine will be deployed. Now, we need to attach the static IP address from the original WordPress website to the new one.\nClick on the Workshop-WordPress virtual machine. Choose the Networking tab. Under the PUBLIC IP section, select Detach. Then, select Yes, detach. Click the Home button at the top of the page and select the new WordPress instance \u0026lsquo;Workshop-WordPress-Medium\u0026rsquo;. Click on the Networking tab. Under the \u0026lsquo;PUBLIC IP\u0026rsquo; section, click on Attach static IP. Choose \u0026lsquo;Workshop-WordPress-IP\u0026rsquo; from the dropdown list, and then click Attach. Now, you can copy the static IP address into your browser and try accessing the website. Press the Home button and click on the three dots on the right of the \u0026lsquo;Workshop-WordPress\u0026rsquo; name. Click on Delete. This will remove the virtual machine but will not delete the manually created snapshot, which we\u0026rsquo;ll keep temporarily as a backup if needed. Click Yes, delete. Now, you will have three virtual machines again. "

	"content": "Create Alarm Alerts are designed to notify administrators when a specific event occurs so that administrators can adjust the instance or gather information about what is happening. Alerts will help you detect incidents if your instance encounters issues, uses high CPU resources, demands additional instances, or moves to a larger instance, as we did in the previous section. In the following steps, you will learn about these alerts and create some alerts for your instance.\nSince PrestaShop is where we theoretically make money, let\u0026rsquo;s focus on that instance for now.\nClick on the instance name Workshop-Prestashop. Then, click on the Metrics Banner button. Under \u0026lsquo;Metric graphs\u0026rsquo;, click on the CPU overview button. Here are all the metrics that customers can see for the version. These metrics are evaluated every 5 minutes. Select CPU burst capacity (percentage). Choose Add alarm. We will create two alarms. One when the burst capacity is below 50% and another when it\u0026rsquo;s below 25%. In this case, you need to keep the option at \u0026ldquo;not greater than or equal to\u0026rdquo; and adjust the input value down to 50%. At the same time, you need to maintain the threshold for 2 occurrences in the last 10 minutes. Choose to receive notifications via Email. When prompted, click on Add contact. Enter a valid email address and click on Add contact. You will need to verify your email address. In this workshop, we won\u0026rsquo;t send any alert notifications. However, if you set up alerts correctly, you will need to verify your email address within 24 hours. Click I understand. Select Expand Advanced settings and review the options, but keep the default values.\nClick Create.\nNow you will see a new alert has been created. Click on \u0026ldquo;Add alarm\u0026rdquo; again, and we will create a second alert. In this workshop, we will keep all the default settings. Choose \u0026ldquo;Send me a notification when the alarm state changes to OK\u0026rdquo; to receive a notification when the alert state changes to OK. Click the \u0026ldquo;Create\u0026rdquo; button to complete the process. If you scroll up on the graph, you will see two lines, each representing one of the two alerts, to display their activation thresholds. \u0026ldquo;You can use these previous steps to set up additional alarms for any versions we have deployed. Identifying issues before they impact your users is a crucial part of your business\u0026rsquo;s continuous operation.\u0026rdquo;\n"
